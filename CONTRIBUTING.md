# Contributing to TASM-Chain

## Important Notice

**TASM-Chain is a thought experiment, not a production system.**

This repository documents a formal kernel derived from a mathematically consistent model. It is not intended to become a deployable blockchain network.

---

## Purpose

TASM-Chain exists to:

1. **Explore alternative conceptual frameworks** for distributed consensus
2. **Demonstrate mathematical rigor** in blockchain formalism
3. **Inspire new perspectives** on state, time, and possibility
4. **Serve as an educational resource** for theoretical computer science

It does **not** aim to:

- Compete with existing blockchain platforms
- Provide production-ready code
- Establish a token or network
- Follow a development roadmap

---

## How to Contribute

While TASM-Chain is theoretical, contributions are welcome in the following areas:

### 1. Documentation Improvements

- **Clarify concepts** that are confusing or poorly explained
- **Add examples** that illustrate the theory
- **Fix typos** and grammatical errors
- **Improve mathematical notation** for precision
- **Translate documentation** to other languages

### 2. Theoretical Extensions

- **Prove theorems** about the formal model
- **Identify edge cases** or contradictions
- **Propose extensions** (e.g., quantum-inspired variants)
- **Draw connections** to other fields (physics, category theory, etc.)
- **Explore implications** of the possibility-collapse paradigm

### 3. Conceptual Implementations

- **Reference implementations** in pseudocode
- **Proof-of-concept** code demonstrating specific aspects
- **Visualization tools** for possibility spaces
- **Simulation environments** for exploring the model

**Note:** Implementations should be educational, not production-oriented.

### 4. Critical Analysis

- **Identify weaknesses** in the theory
- **Compare with existing models** (mathematically)
- **Discuss practical limitations**
- **Explore philosophical implications**

## Contribution Guidelines

### Philosophy

Contributions should maintain the **intellectual integrity** of the project:

- **Rigor over practicality:** Prefer mathematical precision to engineering convenience
- **Clarity over completeness:** Better to explain one concept well than many concepts poorly
- **Conceptual over implementational:** Focus on ideas, not code
- **Theoretical over applied:** This is a thought experiment, not a product

### Style

- **Mathematical formalism:** Use standard notation (set theory, logic, etc.)
- **Precise definitions:** Define terms before using them
- **Examples:** Accompany abstract concepts with concrete examples
- **Citations:** Reference related work in mathematics, computer science, and physics

### Process

1. **Open an issue** to discuss your proposed contribution
2. **Fork the repository** and create a branch
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Submit a pull request** with a detailed description
5. **Engage in discussion** about your contribution

---

## What NOT to Contribute

Please **do not** submit:

- **Production blockchain code** (networks, miners, wallets, etc.)
- **Token economics** or monetary systems
- **Marketing materials** or whitepapers promoting TASM as a product
- **Roadmaps** or development timelines
- **Governance structures** for a hypothetical TASM network
- **Performance optimizations** for deployment (unless purely educational)

These are outside the scope of this thought experiment.

## Intellectual Property

By contributing to TASM-Chain, you agree that:

1. Your contributions are **original work** or properly attributed
2. You grant the project a **non-exclusive, perpetual license** to use your contributions under the same terms as the repository
3. Your contributions will be attributed to you

This project is released into the public domain or under an extremely permissive license. Check the LICENSE file (if present) for specific terms.

**Attribution:** All contributors will be credited in a CONTRIBUTORS.md file (if created).

## Code of Conduct

### Principles

- **Respect intellectual diversity:** Different perspectives are valuable
- **Assume good faith:** Contributors are here to learn and explore
- **Critique ideas, not people:** Focus on the substance, not the person
- **Be patient:** Some concepts are subtle and require time to understand

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or harassment
- Promoting TASM-Chain as a commercial product or investment
- Plagiarism or misattribution
- Off-topic discussions unrelated to the formal model

---

## Areas for Exploration

If you're looking for ideas, consider:

### Theoretical Questions

1. Is the TASM model **mathematically equivalent** to traditional state machines?
2. Can we prove **completeness** or **soundness** of the formal system?
3. What is the **computational complexity** of tracking possibility spaces?
4. How does TASM relate to **modal logic** or **possible worlds semantics**?
5. Can TASM model **quantum superposition** more naturally than traditional blockchains?

### Implementation Questions

1. What **data structures** efficiently represent possibility spaces?
2. How can we implement **constraint satisfaction** at scale?
3. Can **symbolic execution** be used to enumerate possibilities?
4. What **reduction functions** are most practical?
5. How do we detect **contradictions** before they occur?

### Philosophical Questions

1. Does TASM offer genuine **insights** or is it just reframing?
2. What is the relationship between **time** and **possibility** in distributed systems?
3. Is state **emergent** or **constructed**?
4. What does **observer dependence** mean for consensus?
5. Can we reconcile **determinism** with **possibility collapse**?

## Learning Resources

To better understand TASM-Chain, explore:

### Mathematics
- Set theory (for possibility spaces)
- Modal logic (for possible worlds)
- Category theory (for abstract structures)
- Constraint satisfaction (for implementation)

### Computer Science
- State machines and automata theory
- Distributed consensus (Paxos, Raft, etc.)
- Blockchain fundamentals (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Temporal logic (for reasoning about time)

### Physics
- Quantum mechanics (wave function collapse)
- Thermodynamics (entropy and time's arrow)
- Information theory (information loss and irreversibility)

### Philosophy
- Metaphysics of time (eternalism vs. presentism)
- Possible worlds semantics
- Constructivism vs. realism

## Getting Help

If you have questions:

1. **Read the documentation** thoroughly ([docs/](./docs/))
2. **Check existing issues** for similar questions
3. **Open a new issue** with a clear, specific question
4. **Be patient** waiting for responses (maintainers may be unavailable)

---

## Maintainer Notes

This repository is **minimally maintained**. Expect:

- Slow response times to issues and PRs
- Infrequent updates
- Limited active development

TASM-Chain is a **completed thought experiment**, not an active project. Contributions that enhance understanding are welcome, but there is no obligation to maintain production-quality software.

---

## Acknowledgments

TASM-Chain draws inspiration from:

- **Quantum mechanics** (superposition and collapse)
- **Modal logic** (possible worlds)
- **Blockchain research** (consensus mechanisms)
- **Thermodynamics** (entropy and time)
- **Category theory** (abstract mathematical structures)

Thank you to all who engage thoughtfully with this experiment.

## Final Reminder

**This is not a network. This is not a roadmap. This is not a deployable system.**

**This is a formal kernel derived from a mathematically consistent model.**

**State changes because possibilities disappear over time.**

If you understand and accept this, welcome! We look forward to your contributions.
